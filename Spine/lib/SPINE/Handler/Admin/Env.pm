SPINE::Handler::Admin::Env

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a stub admin handler demonstrating how to write your own.

SPINE is a perl based content management system. This release uses mod_perl. It should, in time, support all features of the
CGI based version (but it will ofcourse add new things as well). This is a complete rewrite of the engine.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Most of the installation process takes place in the Apache configuration file.

=head1 VERSION

This is spine 1.3 beta.
