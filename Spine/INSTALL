Mysql Configuration
----------------

Development is based on mysql. Support for other RDBMSs is a bonus.

Create a Database in mysql, e.g. spine (consult the mysql manpages for extra options):

  bash# mysql mysql -p 

in the mysql shell :

  mysql>  create database spine;

Then exit the shell and import the structure: 

  bash# mysql spine -p < mysql3-struct.sql 

Once the database structure is set-up, insert the data:

  bash# mysql spine -p < mysql3-data.sql 

Database permissions might have to be defined. Consult the mysql documentation.

Perl Modules Installation
-----------------------

There is a perl makefile included. Install the modules in the default perl location with:

  bash# perl Makefile.PL
  bash# make

and as root (superuser)

  bash# make install

Make sure you have Apache::Request installed. If you have questions about installing this, consult the administrator.

Apache Configuration
--------------------

Spine is developed for Apache & mod_perl 1.3.x

Edit your apache config file (by default httpd.conf) as follows :

<IfModule mod_perl.c>
 # PerlModule Apache::DBI
 # Remove the # above if you have Apache::DBI installed and you wish to use it

  <Location /spine>
           SetHandler perl-script
           PerlHandler Apache::SPINE::Index
           PerlSetVar dbd mysql
           PerlSetVar dbname spine
           PerlSetVar dbuser user
           PerlSetVar dbpwd password
           PerlSetVar main index.html
           PerlSetVar webmaster 'John Doe'
           PerlSetVar sitename 'SPINE Example site' 
           PerlSetVar chroot /home/www/html
           PerlLogHandler Apache::SPINE::Log
  </Location>

</IfModule>

If your Apache configuration is set up to allow drop in configuration files, use

apache-conf.incl

as a template. On Debian installations, copy the configuration files in

/etc/apache-perl/conf.d

    * The dbname is the database name (you defined earlier).
    * The dbuser is the user as which you connect to mysql (consult your mysql documentation for this setting)
    * The dbpwd is the user password you use to connect to mysql (consult your mysql documentation for this setting)
    * The main variable is 'content' name that is loaded by default (like a index.html).

Restart the webserver, by default by running

apachectl restart

On Debian installations, restart Apache with

./etc/init.d/apache-perl restart

Loading Apache::DBI will improve the access speed to the database by pooling connections. Apache::DBI is not required but recommended. Set the virtual directory you want to use in the location tag.

<Location /directory>

Existing directories and files will still work properly. By default, SPINE will use the mysql DBD driver (You still need this installed on your system - see Requirements list). If you wish to use a different DBD, fill in the appropriate value.

PerlSetVar dbd Pg

If you doubt, ask your system administrator. You can define which database to use for the current virtual directory.

PerlSetVar dbname spine

If you have multiple virtual directories, this setting can prevent record overlapping.

  <Location /bob>
           ...
           PerlSetVar dbname bobdb
           PerlSetVar dbuser bob
            ...
  </Location>

  <Location /john>
           ...
           PerlSetVar dbname johndb
           PerlSetVar dbuser john
            ...
  </Location>

Just make sure you install the default database data first in both databases. Using the main variable, you can define which content will be used by default.

PerlSetVar main index.html

SPINE defined some hardcoded macros. One of those tags is

<?SPINE_Webmaster?>

This tag will be swapped with the value defined in the webmaster variable.

PerlSetVar webmaster 'John Doe'

Another hardcoded macro is the sitename. The macro defined for this value is

<?SPINE_Sitename?>

This tag will be swapped with the value defined in the sitename variable.

PerlSetVar sitename 'SPINE Example site' 

Copy Images
-----------
Copy the images from the images subdir to your main images directory (eg  /var/www/images)
