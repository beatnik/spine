Spine Philosophy ¦

    * Low dependency rate : Dependencies should be minimal for core setup.
    * No programming needed : You don't need to program to create a page
    * Extensibility : Provide easy plugin support
    * Invisible for visitor : Spine should be invisible (for instance, create .html files)
    * Secure : Minimize system calls
    * No need for any components : Don't force using any of the components
    * Portability : Spine should run on any Apache version, on any RDBMS
    * Access restriction : Limit access to all of the admin components
