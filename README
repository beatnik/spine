SPINE v1.1 - Developers Release
----------------------------------

This is a development release SPINE.
You need access to mod_perl and a database. Consult the server administrator if you have questions about these issues.

Any function, layout, database structure is subject to change if needed.

Comments, suggestions and contributions/patches are always welcome.

See INSTALL for more info on installation

See LICENSE for more info on licensing issues.

Since this is a developers release, tons of things are yet unfinished. I test this application on mysql and usually 
then port the data to postgres. In this case, it's been a while since the last postgres port (same goes for SQLite).
