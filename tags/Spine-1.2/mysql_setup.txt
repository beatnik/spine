Setting up initial MySQL users
------------------------------

Although quite trivial, the following might help you setting up initial user permissions for Spine. 
 
The following SQL statement creates a user in MySQL: 
 
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON $database.* TO '$username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$password'; 
 
The following variables are used: 
 
$database : The database name. This value is used in the httpd.conf 'dbname' value.  
$username : The username. This value is used in the httpd.conf 'dbuser' value. 
$password : The password. This value is used in the httpd.conf 'dbpwd' value. 
 
In the MySQL shell, create users as follows: 
 
root@lua:~ # mysql -p mysql 
Enter password: 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \g. 
Your MySQL connection id is 119 to server version: 4.0.24_Debian-10ubuntu2-log 
 
Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer. 
 
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON spine.* TO 'spine'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'spine'; 
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec) 
 
mysql>
