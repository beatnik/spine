HOW SPINE WORKS
---------------

Apache::SPINE::Index
--------------------
Apache::SPINE::Index is a mod_perl content handler. By calling /path the handler is called.
The handler uses Apache::Request and handles the authentication and sets the appropriate HTTP headers.

Apache::SPINE::Index instanciates the DB handler with the details specified in the Apache configuration file.

The content handler calls handler method in the SPINE::Handler::Content class and 
passes the instance of Apache::Request, the database handler and the session (instance of SPINE::Base::Session).
The instance of SPINE::Handler::Content handler will return an instance of SPINE::Base::Content.

The instance SPINE::Base::Content is used to print out the body and the content type of the content.

Each plugin tag is evaluated. Whichever tags are not handled by the content handler, are handled by the plugin handler.
Each tag calls the class method handler in the handler package in the SPINE::Handler:: namespace.
<?SPINE_Plugin?> will call the SPINE::Handler::Plugin::handler method. 
It passes the Apache::Request instance, the database handler, the entire tag parameter and the SPINE::Base::Content instance.
<?SPINE_Plugin("foo")?> will result in "foo" being passed to the handler.
<?SPINE_Plugin("foo",'','',"1")?> will result in "foo",'','',"1" being passed to the handler.
The handler will have to make sure the parameters are parsed properly.


Apache::SPINE::Log
------------------
This is a classic mod_perl log handler. All requests are stored in the database. 


SPINE::DBI::Base
----------------
This is the DBI base class used for inheriting purposes. 

In the inheriting module, redefine the following variables :

  $self->{TABLE} = ""; #This is the table name
  $self->{MODULE} = ""; #This is the module name -> SPINE::Base::MODULENAME
  $self->{ORDER} = 'name'; #Order the output by this field
  $self->{GROUP} = 'name'; #Group the output by this field
  $self->{NUMERIC} = []; #The numeric fields
  $self->{NON_NUMERIC} = []; #The alphanumeric fields
  $self->{FIELDS} = []; #The fields in insert order..
